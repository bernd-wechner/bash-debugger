# bash debugger

This is a simple clone of what is found at: 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/bashdb/files/bashdb/5.0-1.1.2/

a Sourceforge repo that has been stagnant since 2019. It had two identical broken links to documentation as follows:

[tree-structured reference manual](http://www.rodericksmith.plus.com/outlines/manuals/bashdbOutline.html)

The last snapshot of that was found on the [Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org) dated [October 26, 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181026232016/http://www.rodericksmith.plus.com/outlines/manuals/bashdbOutline.html) and saved here as `manual.html`

For now not a finger more has been lifted on this, it has not been tried, tested or otherwise explored simply transferred to a GitHub repo for now with the last copy of it's manual.

As time permits will take a look at it, but in the mean time, anyone else can too, and it's a more visible location I suspect.

Worth noting that there are, at time of transfer here, 9 open bugs on Sourceforge

https://sourceforge.net/p/bashdb/bugs/

dating from 2016 to 2021.

Clearly this could yous a champion to manage and maintain it.
