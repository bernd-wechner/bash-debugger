There is a lot of room for improvement. But since it's only been me working on this, this will have to do.

Although there are a number of gaps the debugger is very usable -- at least for me. It passes the standard GNU Make regression tests, and I
have now added tests for the debugger. For that you need RSpec (a Ruby "gem").

Documentation for the revised GNU Make Debugger is in the doc directory under the name "remake". The wiki https://github.com/rocky/remake/wiki contains other information.
